# FPS-Controller-unity
a VERY simple first person controller based around the old unity input system.

to use: create a new empty game object, drag this script onto it, and parent the main camera (or player camera) onto the empty game object as a child. once done, fill in the values to the empty gameobject.

i may or may not create a more detailed and realisitic version, but not for now.
